        "content": "How does the author propose to fix the problem of science alienation in our educational system? What changes does she suggest should be made to science education? Answer according to: Science education should be split into two tracks.\nSplit K-12 science education into two tracks, for majors and nonmajors.\nThose who want to specialize in science could take math and complex chemistry. Nonmajors would focus on science of the everyday—things like kitchen chemistry and CSI-style crime investigations.\nSome years ago, when I was working as a newspaper science writer in California, I fell into a rather idle conversation with a physicist on the subject of science education. Idle for him, at least, because what he said—the way he defined the American system of teaching K-12 students about science—has stayed with me since.\nThis conversation has returned to me many times over the years. On the day my older son, who spent his childhood joyfully chasing insects and reading natural history books, came home from high school to announce that “biology is the most boring subject in the world.” The time the student adviser at the University of Wisconsin journalism school, where I teach, told me that undergrads don’t want to take science-writing classes because they already felt “beaten up by science.” Even on days when I read science literacy statistics and am startled by the percentage of people who think that antibiotics kill viruses as well as bacteria or that the sun revolves around the Earth.\nIt’s easy for me to join with the chorus of concern over whether we are keeping up as a science-literate country. But even so, science literacy is the wrong term for the worried point I’m making here. I’m concerned about science alienation. The way we teach K-12 science, with its emphasis on the intricacies of formula and mathematical structure necessary for the next generation of scientists and engineers, shuts too many people out. I don’t mean just shut out of the priesthood here; there’s no reason for everyone to become a scientist. But shut out of the comfort zone, of the ability to think of science as something useful in daily life.\nAnd it’s the science-alienated who matter to me. Partly because as a science writer I find them the most interesting audience—I love the idea of seducing someone convinced that science is boring or meaningless into reading a research-centered story. Partly because I worry that what The New Yorker’s Michael Specter describes as a culture of science denialism is having a profound—possibly dangerous—effect on public policies. Think, for instance, of recent moves in Virginia, Texas, and North Carolina to deny that sea level rise is related to global climate change. And partly I just think that the filtered-out are cheated. They endure the mandatory classes, but they never really learn the main lesson—the way that science helps us understand ourselves and the world around us.\nThe great psychologist and philosopher William James wrote more than 100 years ago that the science establishment would face consequences if it dismissed the importance of the lay public. In the year 1909, he said, it was easy to find people who no longer paid attention to the teachings of researchers. “They are indifferent to science,” he explained, “because science is so callously indifferent to their experiences.” Today, this is very relevant to K-12 science education: Our system breeds that indifference.\nHow can we fix it? By requiring even more science education—but changing it dramatically. All high school students should have to take four years of science, instead of the minimal two usually required for graduation. Along with that, we should also offer separate “science tracks”—something like the old tracks for vocational or college-bound students. Those who want to specialize in science could take math, physics, and complex chemistry (and the kind of genetically detailed biology that my son disliked). Nonmajors, by contrast, would focus on what I think of as science of the everyday—things like kitchen chemistry, CSI-style crime investigation, the biology of health, and a class in the physics of sports that would include playing the games.\nMy tracking system could easily build on existing science electives. My son’s school, for instance, teaches a forensic science unit which uses the classroom as an ever changing “crime scene,” exploring everything from DNA analysis to blood typing. It’s a way of putting science in context. More students would take such classes; more would be exposed to these ideas as they did the coursework needed to complete each track. Ideally, the tracks could be coordinated with the science classes offered for majors and nonmajors at the college level. Of course, occasionally a student might want to switch tracks—and we should allow for that, too. It could go both ways: Would-be scientists might realize that the field isn’t really for them and switch to the nonmajor track, while some students might be inspired by the CSI class to move into the more difficult sciences.\nWe need to stop trying to teach every child as either a future scientist or a future failed scientist. We don’t want or need every student to be a scientist, but we do want each one to be a success. And success includes a solid understanding and appreciation of science, one that will remain useful to both themselves and society throughout their lives.\nAlso in Slate’s special issue on science education: Fred Kaplan explains why another “Sputnik moment” would be impossible; Philip Plait explains why he became the “Bad Astronomer”; Paul Plotz describes how almost blowing up his parents’ basement made him a scientist; Tom Kalil says that the Obama administration is using the Make movement to encourage science education; and Dana Goldstein explains why you should make your daughter play video games. Also, share your ideas for fixing science education in the Hive. This article arises from Future Tense, a joint partnership of Slate, the New America Foundation, and Arizona State University."

Here are a few examples:\n\n1. One approach could be to offer different science courses for majors and nonmajors starting in middle school. For example, in 6th grade, students could be divided into two tracks, and each track would take a different science course. In the major track, students would take a course that focuses on the foundations of science, including an emphasis on mathematics and physics. In the nonmajor track, students would take a course that focuses on science concepts that are relevant to everyday life, such as health and nutrition.\n\n2. Another approach could be to offer more advanced science courses in high school for students who wish to pursue a career in science. This could include courses in advanced physics, chemistry, and biology. For students who are not interested in a science career, science courses could be focused on more practical applications of science, such as environmental science or food science.\n\n3. Schools could also offer a wider range of science electives to cater to the varied interests of students. For example, students interested in engineering could take courses in robotics or renewable energy, while those interested in the medical field could take courses in anatomy and physiology.\n\n4. Hands-on science experiments and projects could be incorporated into science classes to make learning more engaging and relevant. For example, students could conduct experiments in their own kitchens to learn about chemical reactions, or participate in a mock crime scene investigation to learn about forensic science.\n\nOverall, the tracking system for science education proposed by the author could be implemented in a variety of ways, depending on the specific needs and interests of students in each school."

Electronic address: andresrodriguez@conicet.gov.ar.\nThe purpose of this research was to identify differences between two contrasting rice cultivars in their response to suboptimal low temperatures stress. A transcriptomic analysis of the seedlings was performed and results were complemented with biochemical and physiological analyses. The microarray analysis showed downregulation of many genes related with PSII and particularly with the oxygen evolving complex in the sensitive cultivar IR50. Complementary studies indicated that the PSII performance, the degree of oxygen evolving complex coupling with the PSII core and net photosynthetic rate diminished in this cultivar in response to the stress. However, the tolerant cultivar Koshihikari was able to maintain its energy equilibrium by sustaining the photosynthetic capacity. The increase of oleic acid in Koshihikari could be related with membrane remodelling of the chloroplasts and hence contribute to tolerance. Overall, these results work as a ground for future analyses that look forward to characterize possible mechanisms to tolerate this stress. How did the tolerant rice cultivar Koshihikari maintain its photosynthetic capacity under suboptimal low temperatures stress, and what possible mechanisms could contribute to its tolerance?"

Dental health and hygiene is not just essential for our overall wellbeing but also a vital aspect of our appearance and self-confidence. However, with each passing year, the cost of dental care has increased, and it has become unaffordable for many families.\n\nFor most people, dental treatment is often an out-of-pocket expense, and not everyone has dental insurance. Even with dental insurance, the co-pays can be quite high, preventing many from seeking the treatment they need. This situation is especially true for those who live in low-income areas, where dental health inequities are common.\n\nThe lack of affordable dental care can have long-lasting effects on individuals and communities. It can lead to poor dental health, which, in turn, can impact one's overall health. Tooth decay, gum disease, and other dental issues can result in infections that can spread beyond the teeth, and this can lead to cardiovascular disease and diabetes.\n\nTo address this issue, we must advocate for more affordable dental care. Our policymakers must prioritize dental health and make it more accessible to those who need it. We need more public health initiatives that focus on educating people on dental care and preventive measures. Additionally, we need more dental clinics and community health centers that provide low-cost or free dental care to underserved populations.\n\nIt is time to take action and bring attention to the issue of affordable dental care. It is not a luxury but a necessity, and everyone deserves access to quality dental care, regardless of their income or social status. I urge you all to join me in this campaign to advocate for more affordable dental care and make it a reality for every American.\n\nThank you."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that impoverished children suffer from untreated tooth decay twice as often as children from higher-income families.\n\n4. A study conducted by the American Dental Association found that nearly 17 million children in the United States go without dental care each year.\n\n5. A survey by the American Dental Association found that in 2018, one in four adults reported having difficulty paying for dental care.\n\nThese statistics demonstrate the critical need for more affordable dental care for all Americans.

Her parents, members of the German Resistance, had been captured and executed by the Nazis, leaving her to fend for herself in a city where speaking out against the regime could result in a swift death.\n\nAs she lay in the cramped space, feeling the weight of the war and the loss of her loved ones, Liesel knew that she could not give up. She had always been courageous, even as a child, and now she had to be even braver.\n\nLiesel spent her days listening carefully to the sounds of the city, watching the troops and tanks roll by on the street above her head. She learned how to scavenge for food and water, how to blend in with the crowds of people going about their daily lives. But every night, she would retreat to her basement, to her solitude, where her grief would overwhelm her.\n\nOne night, however, as Liesel was huddled in her underground shelter, she heard a faint scratching at the door. Timidly, she approached it and, upon opening it, found a small group of strangers: men and women who had also lost loved ones to the war and who were now banding together to fight back against the Nazis.\n\nThe group welcomed Liesel with open arms, recognizing her bravery and her determination. Together, they worked to gather information about their oppressors, to spread information about the war effort to people who had been blinded by propaganda, to offer aid to those who had been mistreated by the Nazis.\n\nFor years, Liesel worked alongside her newfound comrades, risking her life every day to stand up for what was right. And though there were moments of great danger and strife, they never wavered in their conviction, never gave up on their fight.\n\nTowards the end of the war, as the Allied forces closed in on Germany, Liesel and her comrades were captured by the Nazis. They were beaten, starved, and left to die in a concentration camp. But even then, Liesel remained strong, persevering through the hardships and the agony until she was finally rescued by the Allied troops.\n\nYears later, when Liesel was an old woman, her granddaughter would ask her why she had gone through all that she had, why she had risked her life for a cause that so many others had been too afraid to take up. And Liesel would simply smile and say, \"It was the right thing to do. It was the only thing to do.\""

They worked to cultivate relationships with people who had access to valuable information about the Nazi war effort, such as soldiers, government officials, and even civilians who worked in factories or industries crucial to the war effort.\n\nThese spies would report back to Liesel and her team, providing them with details about troop movements, weapons development, and other key information. Sometimes, Liesel and her comrades would go undercover themselves, posing as loyal German citizens or soldiers to gain access to sensitive areas and eavesdrop on conversations.\n\nIn addition to their spy network, Liesel and her comrades also worked to spread information about the war effort and the atrocities being committed by the Nazis. They would create and distribute pamphlets, posters, and other materials that would shed light on the true nature of the war and the horrors being perpetrated against innocent people.\n\nTo get these materials into the hands of as many people as possible, they would leave them in public places, such as train stations or parks, or slip them into people's mailboxes or coat pockets. Of course, this was a very dangerous undertaking, as anyone caught distributing such materials could be arrested and executed.\n\nDespite the risks, Liesel and her comrades never gave up on their mission. They knew that the truth had to be told, no matter the cost. And in the end, their bravery and perseverance paid off, helping to eventually bring an end to the Nazi regime and the horrors of World War II."
